# MonkeyWaker
Hello and welcome to Monkeywaker!
This is a showcase of custom made shaders aping the looks of 'The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker'.

This was made as a school project for the first semester of my Software Development bachelor, during a course on computer graphics.
In this, we have attempted to copy many of the graphical features of the Wind Waker game with our shaders. For example: the look of the sea, the swaying of the palms,  the distinctive shadows, and more.

Included is the source code for the project, as well as a build that can be run to see the graphics in runtime.
